# Viewing Git Commit History

To view the commit history in a Git repository, you can use the following commands:

- `git log`: Shows the commit history with details such as commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

- `git log --oneline`: Shows a simplified, one-line-per-commit view.

- `git log --graph --oneline --all`: Shows a graphical representation of the commit history.

Example usage:

```
git log
```

or

```
git log --oneline
```

These commands should be run in the terminal inside your Git repository directory.
